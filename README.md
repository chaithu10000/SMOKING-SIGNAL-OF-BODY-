## Overview

**SmokeSmart: Data-Driven Smoking Habit Reduction** is a data science project aimed at understanding the physiological signals associated with smoking behavior. By leveraging machine learning models, the project provides insights that can be used to develop strategies for smoking cessation and habit reduction.

The project involves a comprehensive analysis of the **Body Signal of Smoking** dataset from Kaggle, utilizing various data visualization techniques and machine learning algorithms to predict smoking habits.

## Features

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: In-depth exploration of the dataset using Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Plotly for data visualization.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical data, and scaling features using various preprocessing techniques.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implementation of Random Forest, LightGBM, and XGBoost classifiers to predict smoking habits.
- **Model Evaluation**: Use of confusion matrix, accuracy score, ROC-AUC score, and other metrics to evaluate model performance.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimization of model hyperparameters using GridSearchCV and cross-validation.
- **Stacking Classifier**: Implementation of ensemble learning techniques to improve model performance.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the **Body Signal of Smoking** dataset from Kaggle. It includes various physiological signals collected from individuals who are smokers and non-smokers. The dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets).
